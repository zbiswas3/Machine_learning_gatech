Neural Network with Different Optimization Algorithm are at following jython files: 
Genetic Algorithm :  ANN_GA.py
Simulated Algorithm: ANN_SA.py
Random Hill Climbing: ANN_SA.py


Three Interesting problems jython Codes: 
Continuous Peaks : continuouspeaks.py
Flipflop: flipflop.py
Knapsack : knapsack.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE CODES:
All code file needs to include Abagail.jar file in its sys path. My codes are edited according my computer directory. This code may need to be modified according to the coputer of the user. 


----------------------------------------------------------------
All the codes are taken (stolen*) and modified from Abagail and John Tay
